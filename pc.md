## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? To work on an issue and it prevents multiple people from working on the main branch and instead making changes in a branch to later merge back into the main.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To compare the differences between the main branch and your branch and also to merge back into the main branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout "existing branch here" or git switch "existing branch here"
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? `git fetch` you add changes from the remote repo to your local branch without commiting them. `git pull` is used to getch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match. `git merge`  merges two branches back together.
7. What is a merge conflict? this can happen when different people make changes to the same line of code or one person deletes a file and another edits the same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? click the resolve conflicts button and determine which branch changes you want to keep or make a new change to incorporate both changes.
